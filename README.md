## Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Easily extendable and customizable.
- **User-friendly API:** Simple and intuitive RESTful API endpoints for training and predicting.
- **Plugin Support:** Add custom AI models and data processing tools with ease.
- **Pre-trained Models Integration:** Support for popular AI libraries like TensorFlow and Hugging Face.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Track training processes and model performance.

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bayrameker/ai-spark.git
cd ai-spark
```

Build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

### Training a Model

To train a new model, use the `/api/model/train` endpoint. Here is an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/model/train \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "modelType": "neural_network",
  "trainingData": "..."
}'
```

### Making Predictions

To make a prediction with a trained model, use the `/api/model/predict` endpoint. Here is an example using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/model/predict \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "modelId": "1234",
  "inputData": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
}'
```

## Modules

### ai-spark-core

This module contains the core functionalities for AI model training and prediction.

#### Key Components

- **ModelTrainingService:** Service for training AI models.
- **PredictionService:** Service for making predictions with trained models.
- **AIModel:** Base class for AI models.

### ai-spark-api

This module provides RESTful API endpoints for interacting with AI models.

#### Key Endpoints

- **/api/model/train:** Train a new model.
- **/api/model/predict:** Make predictions with a trained model.

## Docker Deployment

To deploy AI Spark using Docker, follow these steps:

### Build Docker Images

```bash
# Core module
cd ai-spark-core
docker build -t ai-spark-core .

# API module
cd ../ai-spark-api
docker build -t ai-spark-api .
```

### Run Docker Containers

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ai-spark-core
docker run -p 8081:8081 ai-spark-api
```
